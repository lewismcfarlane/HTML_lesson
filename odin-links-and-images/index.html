    <!-- <a href="DESTINATION" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" -->
    <!-- target"_blank" opens link in a new tab, rel="noopener noreferrer" is in place for security reasons -->
    <!-- for good practice, always add this rel tag to provide security
    noreferrer prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource
    has a link or reference to it. 
    noopener prevents the opened link from gaining acces to the webpage
    from which it opened. It's to protect against phishing.
    This is referred to as tabnabbing. INCLUDE THIS IN ALL LINKS TO
    OTHER PAGES -->
    <!-- Without this security, the webpage is vulnerable to window.opener
    API exploitation attacks. Most modern broswers have this security built in
    but as good practice, always include it. -->

    <!-- Two types of links, absolute and relative links
    1. Links to pages on other websites/the internet
    2. Links to pages located on our own websites

    Absolute links are links to other websites on the internet
    https://www.theodinproject.com/about
    protocol:://domain/path

    Relative links are links to pages within our own website.
    these links do not include a domain name as it assumes the domain name is the same

    <!-- Adding ./directory/page.hmtl
    the ./ specifies to the code that it should look for the
    file/directory relative to the current directory -->
